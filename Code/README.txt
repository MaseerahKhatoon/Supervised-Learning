> The code for two classifications comparisons is included here.

	Classification 1 : titanic-code
	Classification 2 : crop-recommend-code

> Each of these is a .py file. 

> The 5 algorithms are within each file for the particular classification, i.e, titanic-code includes the algorithms
  for the 5 supervised learning models implemented on Dataset 1 and similarly for Dataset 2.
